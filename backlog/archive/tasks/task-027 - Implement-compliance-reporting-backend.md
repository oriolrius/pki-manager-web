## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create backend endpoints for generating compliance reports: certificate inventory report, revocation report, and CA operations report in CSV and PDF formats.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 audit.generateReport endpoint implemented
- [x] #2 Certificate Inventory Report generation
- [x] #3 Revocation Report generation
- [x] #4 CA Operations Report generation
- [x] #5 Date range filtering
- [x] #6 CA filtering
- [x] #7 CSV format export
- [ ] #8 PDF format export (with professional formatting)
- [x] #9 Report includes header with generation date
- [x] #10 Report includes summary statistics
- [x] #11 Report includes tamper-evident hash

- [ ] #12 Unit tests implemented and passing
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Create audit.generateReport tRPC endpoint
2. Implement Certificate Inventory Report (certificates with details)
3. Implement Revocation Report (revoked certificates)
4. Implement CA Operations Report (CA lifecycle events)
5. Add date range and CA filtering
6. Implement CSV export using json2csv or similar
7. Implement PDF export using pdfkit or similar
8. Add report header with generation date
9. Add summary statistics
10. Add tamper-evident hash (SHA256 of report content)
11. Write unit tests
12. Test all acceptance criteria

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Implemented compliance reporting backend with audit.generateReport endpoint:

**Completed:**
- audit.generateReport tRPC endpoint (AC #1)
- Certificate Inventory Report with full certificate details (AC #2)
- Revocation Report with revocation details (AC #3)
- CA Operations Report from audit log (AC #4)
- Date range filtering (startDate, endDate) (AC #5)
- CA filtering (caId parameter) (AC #6)
- CSV format export with proper formatting (AC #7)
- Report header with generation date (AC #9)
- Summary statistics for each report type (AC #10)
- Tamper-evident SHA256 hash of report content (AC #11)

**Not Implemented:**
- PDF format export (AC #8) - requires PDF library (pdfkit/puppeteer)
- Dedicated unit tests for reports (AC #12) - existing audit tests pass

**Implementation Details:**
Created generateReport mutation that:
1. Queries database based on report type and filters
2. Generates CSV with comment header including:
   - Report name and generation timestamp
   - Applied filters (CA, date range)
   - Summary statistics
   - SHA256 hash for tamper detection
3. Returns structured response with content, summary, and metadata
4. Logs report generation to audit trail

**Files Modified:**
- backend/src/trpc/schemas.ts (added generateReportSchema)
- backend/src/trpc/procedures/audit.ts (implemented generateReport endpoint)

**Report Types:**
- certificate_inventory: All certificates with status breakdown
- revocation: Revoked certificates with revocation details
- ca_operations: CA lifecycle events from audit log
