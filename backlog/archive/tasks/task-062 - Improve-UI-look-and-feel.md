<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

- [x] #2 Blue colors replaced with orange brand colors throughout the app
- [x] #3 Dashboard stats grid redesigned to use less vertical space
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Completed UI improvements (second iteration after user feedback):

**Font Awesome Integration:**
- Installed @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core, @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons, @fortawesome/react-fontawesome
- Added FA icons to navigation: chart-line (Dashboard), shield (CAs), certificate (Certificates), layer-group (Bulk)
- Added FA icons to dashboard stats: shield, shield-halved, certificate, file-contract
- Added FA icons to certificate detail page: arrow-left, download, rotate, circle-xmark, trash

**Dashboard Stats Grid Redesign:**
- Completely redesigned layout from vertical to horizontal compact design
- Changed padding from p-6 (24px) to px-3 py-2 (12px horizontal, 8px vertical)
- Icon on left, number and label on same baseline for space efficiency
- Reduced vertical height by ~40%

**Color Scheme Updates:**
- Replaced blue backgrounds with orange (primary) in: bulk action bars, info boxes, submit buttons, CSV guides
- KEPT different colors for certificate types: Server (blue), Client (green), Code Signing (purple), Email (cyan), CA (orange)
- This preserves visual distinction between certificate types while using brand colors for UI elements

**React Dependency Fix:**
- Resolved React version conflict that caused FontAwesomeIcon hook errors
- Ran pnpm install to properly handle workspace and remove duplicate React installations
- Verified React 19.2.0 is the only version in use
