## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create audit logging infrastructure that captures all operations across the application. Store in audit_log table with proper structure and metadata.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Audit logging function/middleware created
- [x] #2 All CA operations logged (create/revoke/delete)
- [x] #3 All certificate operations logged (issue/renew/revoke/delete/download)
- [ ] #4 All CRL operations logged (generate/publish)
- [ ] #5 KMS operations linked in audit log
- [x] #6 Audit log entries include timestamp, operation, entity, status, details
- [x] #7 Audit logs are immutable (append-only)
- [x] #8 IP address captured when available
- [x] #9 Details stored as JSON

- [x] #10 Unit tests implemented and passing
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Examine existing audit_log table schema
2. Create audit logging utility function
3. Integrate audit logging into CA procedures (create/revoke/delete)
4. Integrate audit logging into certificate procedures (issue/renew/revoke/delete/download)
5. Prepare structure for CRL audit logging (endpoints don't exist yet)
6. Link KMS operations in audit logs
7. Write unit tests for audit logging
8. Test all operations to ensure audit logs are created correctly

## Implementation Summary

Implemented comprehensive audit logging infrastructure for the PKI Manager application.

### What Was Implemented

1. **Audit Logging Utility Library** (`backend/src/lib/audit.ts`)
   - Created `createAuditLog()` function for consistent audit log creation
   - Added `auditSuccess()` and `auditFailure()` helper functions
   - Supports all required fields: operation, entityType, entityId, status, details, ipAddress, kmsOperationId
   - Graceful error handling to prevent audit logging failures from breaking main operations

2. **Audit Log List Endpoint** (`backend/src/trpc/procedures/audit.ts`)
   - Implemented `audit.list` endpoint with comprehensive filtering:
     - Filter by operation, entityType, entityId, status
     - Date range filtering (startDate, endDate)
     - Pagination support (limit, offset)
   - Returns audit logs in descending timestamp order (most recent first)
   - Parses JSON details field for client consumption
   - Self-audits list queries (non-blocking)

3. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**
   - Created unit tests for audit utility functions (`backend/src/lib/audit.test.ts`)
   - Created integration tests for audit.list endpoint (`backend/src/trpc/procedures/audit.test.ts`)
   - All tests passing (18 tests total)

### Already Implemented (Prior Work)

Audit logging was already in place for all CA and certificate operations:
- CA operations: create, revoke, delete (both success and failure)
- Certificate operations: issue, renew, revoke, delete, download (both success and failure)
- All operations capture: timestamp, operation, entityType, entityId, ipAddress, status, details JSON

### Remaining Work

- AC #4: CRL operations audit logging will be added when CRL endpoints are implemented (task-022, task-023, task-024)
- AC #5: KMS operations linking - The infrastructure supports kmsOperationId, but KMS service integration would need to be enhanced to return operation IDs

### Files Modified/Created

- Created: `backend/src/lib/audit.ts`
- Modified: `backend/src/trpc/procedures/audit.ts`
- Created: `backend/src/lib/audit.test.ts`
- Created: `backend/src/trpc/procedures/audit.test.ts`

### Testing

All tests passing:
- 8 tests for audit utility
- 10 tests for audit list endpoint
