## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Implement the tRPC endpoint for issuing server (TLS/SSL) certificates. Generate key pair in KMS, create CSR, sign with CA key, store certificate, and create audit log entry.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 certificate.issue endpoint implemented for server type
- [x] #2 Input validation for server certificate fields
- [x] #3 Domain name validation for CN
- [x] #4 SAN DNS names validation (including wildcards)
- [x] #5 SAN IP addresses validation (IPv4/IPv6)
- [x] #6 Key pair generated in KMS
- [x] #7 Certificate signed by CA private key via KMS
- [x] #8 Certificate stored in database with metadata
- [ ] #9 CRL Distribution Point extension added
- [ ] #10 Key Usage and Extended Key Usage set correctly
- [x] #11 Maximum validity of 825 days enforced
- [x] #12 Serial number unique per CA
- [x] #13 Audit log entry created
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Create validation utilities for domain names and SANs
2. Implement the certificate.issue endpoint:
   - Validate input fields (server type, DN, SANs, validity)
   - Retrieve and validate CA exists and is active
   - Generate unique serial number for certificate
   - Create key pair in KMS
   - Prepare certificate parameters with extensions
   - Sign certificate using CA private key via KMS
   - Store certificate in database
   - Create audit log entry
3. Add proper error handling and logging
4. Test with various inputs

## Implementation Summary

Implemented server certificate issuance endpoint at `certificate.issue` with comprehensive validation and KMS integration.

### Key Features Implemented

- **Input Validation**: Full validation for server certificate fields including domain names, SANs (DNS with wildcard support, IPv4/IPv6 addresses), and validity period (max 825 days)
- **CA Verification**: Validates CA exists, is active, and not expired before issuance
- **KMS Integration**: 
  - Generates certificate key pair in KMS
  - Signs certificate using CA private key via KMS certify operation
- **Database Storage**: Stores certificate with full metadata including SANs as JSON
- **Audit Logging**: Creates detailed audit log entry for all certificate issuance attempts (success/failure)
- **Unique Serial Numbers**: KMS generates cryptographically unique serial numbers per certificate

### Files Modified/Created

- `backend/src/trpc/procedures/certificate.ts` - Implemented certificate.issue endpoint
- `backend/src/crypto/validation.ts` - Created validation utilities for domain names, IP addresses, and SANs
- `backend/src/crypto/index.ts` - Exported validation utilities

### Validation Implemented

1. Domain name validation (RFC compliant, supports wildcards in first label only)
2. SAN DNS name validation (including wildcard patterns)
3. SAN IP address validation (both IPv4 and IPv6)
4. Certificate validity period enforcement (1-825 days for server certs)
5. CA status and expiration checks

### Known Limitations

**AC #9 (CRL Distribution Point)**: Not fully implemented - requires CRL infrastructure setup. Added TODO comment in code for future implementation.

**AC #10 (Key Usage and Extended Key Usage)**: Documented in code but limited by KMS certify operation capabilities. The current KMS certify implementation may not support custom certificate extensions. Full extension support would require either:
- Enhanced KMS API to accept extension parameters in certify operation
- Alternative approach using local certificate generation with HSM-based signing

Both limitations are documented in the code with clear TODO/NOTE comments and can be addressed in future iterations when CRL infrastructure is ready or KMS capabilities are extended.
