## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Set up the initial project structure with separate frontend and backend directories, configure build tools, and establish the monorepo architecture for the PKI Manager application.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Project directory structure created with frontend/ and backend/ folders
- [x] #2 Package.json files configured for both frontend and backend
- [x] #3 TypeScript configuration set up for both projects
- [x] #4 Build scripts and tooling configured
- [x] #5 Development environment can be started successfully
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Create project directory structure (frontend/, backend/)
2. Initialize pnpm workspace with root package.json
3. Set up backend package with TypeScript, Fastify, and tRPC dependencies
4. Set up frontend package with React 19, Vite, and TanStack dependencies
5. Configure TypeScript for both projects
6. Add build and dev scripts
7. Test that development environment starts successfully
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Created complete monorepo structure with pnpm workspaces.

Implemented:
- Root package.json with workspace configuration and scripts
- pnpm-workspace.yaml defining frontend and backend packages
- Backend package with Fastify, tRPC v11, better-sqlite3, Drizzle ORM
- Frontend package with React 19, Vite, TanStack Router and Query, Tailwind CSS v4
- TypeScript strict mode configuration for both packages
- Basic tRPC server and router setup with health check endpoint
- Basic React app with TanStack Router and tRPC client integration
- Development scripts that start both servers in parallel
- Project documentation (README.md)
- Git ignore configuration
- Environment variable templates

Tested:
- All dependencies install successfully with pnpm install
- Backend server starts on port 3000 with Fastify and tRPC
- Frontend development server ready (Vite on port 5173)
- TypeScript compilation works for both packages

Next tasks can build on this foundation to implement database schema, KMS integration, and UI components.
