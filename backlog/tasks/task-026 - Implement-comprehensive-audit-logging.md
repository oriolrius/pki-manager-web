## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create audit logging infrastructure that captures all operations across the application. Store in audit_log table with proper structure and metadata.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Audit logging function/middleware created
- [x] #2 All CA operations logged (create/revoke/delete)
- [x] #3 All certificate operations logged (issue/renew/revoke/delete/download)
- [ ] #4 All CRL operations logged (generate/publish)
- [ ] #5 KMS operations linked in audit log
- [x] #6 Audit log entries include timestamp, operation, entity, status, details
- [x] #7 Audit logs are immutable (append-only)
- [x] #8 IP address captured when available
- [x] #9 Details stored as JSON

- [x] #10 Unit tests implemented and passing
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Examine existing audit_log table schema
2. Create audit logging utility function
3. Integrate audit logging into CA procedures (create/revoke/delete)
4. Integrate audit logging into certificate procedures (issue/renew/revoke/delete/download)
5. Prepare structure for CRL audit logging (endpoints don't exist yet)
6. Link KMS operations in audit logs
7. Write unit tests for audit logging
8. Test all operations to ensure audit logs are created correctly
