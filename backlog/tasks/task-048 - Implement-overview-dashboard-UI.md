## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Implemented comprehensive dashboard UI with all required features:

**Summary Cards:**
- Total CAs with active count
- Total Certificates with CA count
- Expiring Soon (30 days) with highlighted orange styling
- Revoked Certificates count
- All cards clickable and navigate to relevant views

**Charts & Visualizations:**
- Certificate Expiry Timeline: 12-month line chart showing upcoming expirations
- Certificate Status Distribution: Pie chart (Active, Expired, Revoked)
- Certificate Type Distribution: Pie chart (Server, Client, Code Signing, Email)
- Certificates by CA: Bar chart showing certificate count per CA
- All charts use Recharts library with responsive containers

**Activity & Actions:**
- Recent Activity Feed: Last 10 audit log entries with color-coded actions and relative timestamps
- Expiring Soon Table: Certificates expiring in next 30 days with day count badges
- Quick Actions: Buttons for common tasks (View CAs, Create CA, Issue Certificate, View All Certs)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Installed and configured Recharts library
- Uses tRPC queries: ca.list, certificate.list, audit.list
- Proper loading and error states for all data sections
- Responsive grid layout using Tailwind (md:grid-cols-2, lg:grid-cols-3, lg:grid-cols-4)
- Color-coded status indicators throughout
- Relative time formatting for activity feed
- Navigation integration with TanStack Router

**Files Modified:**
- frontend/src/routes/index.tsx (replaced basic health check with full dashboard)
- frontend/package.json (added recharts dependency)

All acceptance criteria verified and checked.
