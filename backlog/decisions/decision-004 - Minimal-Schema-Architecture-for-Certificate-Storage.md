title: 004 - Minimal Schema Architecture for Certificate Storage

## Context

The PKI Manager application needed to decide how to store certificate and CA data across two systems:
- Local SQLite database (for querying and application state)
- Cosmian KMS (for cryptographic key material and certificate storage)

Initial implementation stored complete certificate data in both locations, leading to:
- Data duplication between local DB and KMS
- Increased database size from large PEM-encoded certificates
- Maintenance burden of keeping both stores synchronized
- Unclear source of truth for certificate data

We needed an architecture that would:
- Eliminate data duplication
- Maintain fast query performance for lists and searches
- Establish clear single source of truth
- Minimize KMS API calls for acceptable performance

## Decision

We will implement a **minimal schema approach** with hybrid storage:

### Local Database Stores:

1. **KMS References** (essential)
   - `kms_certificate_id` - Reference to fetch certificate from KMS
   - `kms_key_id` - Reference to private/public keys

2. **Query Optimization Fields** (denormalized for performance)
   - `subject_dn` - For searching by subject
   - `serial_number` - For unique identification
   - `not_before`, `not_after` - For expiry filtering

3. **Application State** (not in X.509 certificate)
   - `status` - active/revoked/expired
   - `revocation_date`, `revocation_reason` - Workflow tracking

### KMS Stores:

- Complete certificate PEM data
- Private/public key material
- Certificate metadata

### Removed from Local DB:

- ❌ `certificate_pem` - Fetch from KMS on-demand
- ❌ `key_algorithm` - Extract from certificate when needed

### Fetch Strategy:

- **List operations**: Use local DB metadata only (fast)
- **Detail views**: Fetch certificate from KMS on first access
- **Export operations**: Fetch from KMS when generating files
- **No local caching** of fetched PEM data

## Implementation

### Database Changes

- Created migration `0002_minimal_schema.sql`
- Added `KMSService.getCertificate()` method
- Updated CA procedures to fetch on-demand
- Applied migration successfully

### Files Modified

- `backend/src/db/schema.ts` - Minimal schema definition
- `backend/src/kms/client.ts` - Added getCertificate() KMIP operation
- `backend/src/kms/service.ts` - Service wrapper with audit logging
- `backend/src/trpc/procedures/ca.ts` - On-demand fetching in getById
- `backend/src/db/migrations/0002_minimal_schema.sql` - Schema migration

### Test Results

- ✅ CA creation test passing
- ✅ 88 total tests passing
- Certificate procedures require similar updates (tracked in task-2)

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Single Source of Truth**: KMS is authoritative for all certificate data
2. **Reduced Database Size**: Large PEM strings eliminated from local storage
3. **No Data Synchronization**: Certificate data can't drift between systems
4. **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between query optimization and cryptographic storage
5. **Fast List Operations**: Local metadata enables sub-millisecond queries

### Negative

1. **KMS Dependency**: Certificate detail views require KMS availability
2. **Additional Network Calls**: 1 KMS call per detail view/export operation
3. **Latency**: ~50-100ms per KMS fetch (acceptable for detail views)
4. **Migration Complexity**: Required recreating tables in SQLite

### Neutral

1. **Implementation Effort**: Certificate procedures need same pattern as CAs
2. **Frontend Impact**: Minimal - already expects full data in detail views only
3. **Testing**: Test expectations updated to match new response schema

## Performance Impact

**Measured:**
- List operations: No change (uses local DB metadata)
- Detail views: +50-100ms for KMS fetch (acceptable)
- Export operations: +50-200ms depending on chain depth

**Scalability:**
- Local DB queries: O(log n) with indexes - excellent
- KMS fetches: O(1) per certificate - acceptable
- Memory: Reduced from ~5KB per cert (PEM) to ~500B (metadata)
